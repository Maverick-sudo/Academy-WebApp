Scripts can be placed in the `<body>`, in the `<head>`, or in both.\n\nJavaScript can \"display\" data in different ways:\n- Using `.innerHTML`: `document.getElementById(\"id\").innerHTML` (the `id` attribute identifies the element; `innerHTML` sets the element’s HTML content)\n- Using `document.write()`: using `document.write()` after an HTML document is loaded will delete all existing HTML. The `document.write()` method should only be used for testing.\n- Using `window.alert()`: `window` is the global scope object in browsers (so specifying `window` is optional)\n- Using `console.log()`: for debugging, call `console.log()` to print to the browser console\n\nWhen JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can react to EVENTS (things that happen to HTML elements, e.g. page load, button click, input f"

As a developer you write Python (`.py`) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:\n```bash\n$ python name-of-script.py\n```\n\nA Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyzer: `Lexical_Analyzer —> Stream of Tokens —> Parser`.\n\nTo test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself. Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:\n- `python` (for MacBook)\n- `py` (for Windows)\n\nWhenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface: `exi"

In cryptography, hiding data is called encryption and unhiding it is called decryption. When data is securely exchanged, it is first encrypted by the sender, and then decrypted by the receiver using a special key. For Instance, Computers encrypt using XOR is an operation that compares two bits and returns True (1) if only one of the bits is 1, and returns False (0), if the bits are the same value (both 0’s or both 1’s).\n\n- **Symmetric encryption** uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data.\n- **Asymmetric encryption** uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. Asymmetric encryption is the most secure way to transmit data; however, it is slower and more complex than symmetric encryption. Therefore, it is primarily used to exchange smaller pieces of data. Encryption is the most powerful single tool for protecting netwo"

It performs all necessary manipulations there before applying the final changes to the browser's DOM, thus changing only what needs to be changed.\n\n### The Virtual DOM\n\nThe Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details. Since the DOM is already an abstraction, the virtual DOM is an abstraction of an abstraction. Think of the virtual DOM as React’s local and simplified copy of the HTML DOM. It allows React to do its computations within this abstract world.\n\nIn React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightw"
