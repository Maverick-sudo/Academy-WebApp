Access Layer Switches typically have many ports. QoS marking is typically done here (early stage in a packet's life), and security services like Port Security, DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection), and DHCP snooping are implemented.

Some security model researchers identify other properties that secure systems should exhibit; the most important of these is **Non-Repudiation**.\n\n**Non-Repudiation** means that a subject cannot deny doing something, such as modifying, creating, or sending a resource. A secure information processing system must demonstrate all properties within the goal of ensuring information security. Within the goal of ensuring Information Security, **Cybersecurity** refers specifically to provisioning secure/hardened processing hardware and software.

React is used to build single-page applications and allows us to build and create reusable UI components.\n\nInstead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory. It performs all necessary manipulations there before applying the final changes to the browser's DOM, thus changing only what needs to be changed.\n\n### The Virtual DOM\n\nThe Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details. Since the DOM is already an abstraction, the virtual DOM is an abstraction of an abstraction. Think of the virtual DOM as React’s local and simplified copy of the HTML DOM. It allows React to do its computations within this abstract world.\n\nIn React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like a lightw"
