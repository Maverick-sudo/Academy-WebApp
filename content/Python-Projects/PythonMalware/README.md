# PythonMalware

## Overview
This folder contains scripts that demonstrate malware‑like behaviors for analysis and defensive study.

## How It Works
- **download_evil_files.py** downloads a file from a URL and writes it to disk.
- **download_execute_report.py** downloads a file to a temp directory, executes a command, emails results, and removes the downloaded file.
- **execute_and_report.py** uses system commands to list saved Wi‑Fi profiles and emails the results.
- **keylogger.py** captures keystrokes via `pynput` and sends periodic email reports.
- **queue_Usage.py** demonstrates a worker queue pattern.
- **threadingExample.py** compares single‑threaded and multi‑threaded execution times.
