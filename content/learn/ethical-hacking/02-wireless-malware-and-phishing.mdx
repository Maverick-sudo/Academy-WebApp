### Network Segmentation

Network Segmentation is the basic practice of breaking apart larger networks into smaller, functionally similar networks with differ. In segmenting networks, we should consider:

- Which assets are we trying to protect?
- Who can access which networks?

These questions naturally lead us to access control lists that determine who can connect to which networks.

Often the first place people start is just implementing a guest network that’s separate from the rest of your network environment

### Access Point Placement

It is important we consider both the placement and strength of our access points. Access points are the systems and nodes used to distribute wireless signals. If an attacker can access the network, they may be able to attack the users on the network!

### Encryption

All wireless activity should be securely encrypted. Currently, the accepted standard for security is WPA2. WPA2-Personal will require a single password to access Wi-Fi, while WPA2-Enterprise will require multi-factor authentication.

It’s recommended to set your own network name and password when you set up your wireless Internet at home, instead of using the default one that comes with the router!

### Network Traffic Analysis

The ability to analyze network communications is crucial!

WireShark How to use: https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChUseMainWindowSection.html

In order to analyze your traffic on Wireshark, we need to choose the correct Interface. Depending on your computer’s settings you are likely using either the Wi-Fi or Ethernet interface. If neither of those interfaces appears choose on the graph with the most activity. As soon as we chose an interface by double-clicking on it, we’ll see traffic start flooding in. While this may seem overwhelming, the key to network analysis is filtering out noise.

Personal Security Best Practices➡️Account Safety & Password Management
Today, there are common methods to guess passwords in a variety of ways, such as brute-forcing, credential stuffing, dictionary attacks, and rainbow tables.

Hardening is the process of fortifying a system against attacks. When we harden computers, we are generally focused on fortifying the operating system, making sure that it is as secure as it can be.
Hardening is a balancing act: too little of it, and the computer is vulnerable to attacks, but too much hardening can make a computer impractical to use.
Computers are complicated machines. If we had to communicate with the hardware directly, we would never get anything done! That’s why computer scientists and engineers created operating systems. Operating systems (OS for short) are pre-loaded sets of software that handle the details of keeping a computer running, provide services to applications, and make it easy for us to interact with our computers. If the hardware of a computer is its brain, the operating system is its consciousness and also its protection from cyber attacks.


## Five Stages of Hacking

### Reconnaissance—Information Gathering

- Bugcrowd.com  Find Vulnerabilities Other Tools Miss
- Hunter.io Hunter lets you find professional email addresses in seconds
- Wappalyzer is a browser extension that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects content management systems, eCommerce platforms, web servers, JavaScript frameworks, analytics tools and many more.

### Scanning & Enumeration

- Gaining Access
- Maintaining Access
- Covering Tracks

## Malware

### Malware Types and Definitions

- **Malware:** Malicious-Software code inserted into a system to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to a network
- **Adware:** Unwanted software designed to throw advertisements on your screen
- **Virus:** A malicious self-replacing application that attaches itself to other programs and executables without the permission of the user
- **Worm:** Self-replicating code that copies itself from computer to computer without user intervention
- **Spyware:** Malicious code downloaded without a user’s authorization which is then used to steal sensitive information and relay it to an outside party in a way that harms the original user
- **Trojan Horse:** A type of contained, non-replicating malware that disguises itself as legitimate software in order to allow scammers and hackers access to a user’s system
- **Root-kit:** A collection of malicious programs that secretly provide continued, privileged access to a system for an unauthorized user/intruder
- **Ransomware:** Malicious code that will block a user’s access to data or threaten to publish sensitive data until they pay money to the malicious actor
- **File-less Malware:** A type of malware that ‘lives off the land’ and uses legitimate tools and the user’s operating system to perform malicious activities like privilege escalation, data collection, and more. It’s incredibly hard to detect and almost always missed by antivirus software.

## Phishing

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that can take many forms. For example, vishing, (voice phishing), smishing (SMS phishing), and webpages that harvest credentials are all threats. Attackers can also send emails that look like they are from legitimate senders by using spoofing.   If the target is extremely sought after, like the CEO of a company, it is known as whaling.
