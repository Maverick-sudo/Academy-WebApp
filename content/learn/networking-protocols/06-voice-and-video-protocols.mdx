Voice over IP (VoIP) and Video Teleconferencing have become standard communication methods. Many networks are upgrading from legacy voice services to IP-based protocols and products. Voice and video communication over IP networks has become ubiquitous, replacing traditional circuit-switched telephony and enabling rich multimedia experiences. These services rely on a suite of specialized protocols to ensure real-time delivery, quality of service (QoS), and session management. This chapter explores the foundational protocols that enable voice (VoIP) and video communication across IP networks.
Voice over IP (VoIP) Fundamentals

Voice over IP (VoIP) is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. It functions by converting analog audio signals into digital packets that are then transmitted over the network.  

Key Components of a VoIP System:
    IP Phones: Devices that convert voice into IP packets and vice-versa. Can be hardware or software (softphones).
    VoIP Gateways: Connect traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) lines to IP networks, allowing calls between the two.
    Call Processors/IP PBX (Private Branch Exchange): Manage call setup, routing, and features like voicemail, conferencing, etc.
    Codecs: Algorithms used to compress and decompress digital audio signals. Examples include G.711 (PCMU/PCMA), G.729, G.722.

## Legacy Voice Services

Legacy voice services traditionally use the **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)**. A common residential telephone installation would be serviced by a simple box providing a single analog interface to the local exchange. This analog interface is known as **Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)**, where each line provides a single channel for incoming and outgoing calls.

For businesses requiring many voice lines, a **digital trunk line** is used, often referred to as **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**. A TDM circuit can multiplex separate voice data channels for transmission over a single cable.
