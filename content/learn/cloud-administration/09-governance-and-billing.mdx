AWS Trusted Advisor is a web service that inspects your AWS environment and provides real-time recommendations in accordance with AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor compares its findings to AWS best practices in five categories: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits. For the checks in each category, Trusted Advisor offers a list of recommended actions and additional resources to learn more about AWS best practices.
When you access the Trusted Advisor dashboard on the AWS Management Console, you can review completed checks for cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance, and service limits.
For each category: The green check indicates the number of items for which it detected no problems. The orange triangle represents the number of recommended investigations. The red circle represents the number of recommended actions. The inspection includes security checks, such as Amazon S3 buckets with open access permissions.

* Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that enables you to monitor and manage various metrics for the resources that run your applications.
* AWS CloudTrail is a web service that enables you to review details for user activities and API calls that have occurred within your AWS environment.
* Amazon GuardDuty is a service that provides intelligent threat detection for your AWS environment and resources. It identifies threats by continuously monitoring the network activity and account behavior within your AWS environment.

To learn more about types of high availability, expand each of the following two categories.
With an Active-Passive system, only one of the two instances is available at a time. One advantage of this method is that for stateful applications (where data about the client’s session is stored on the server), there won’t be any issues. This is because the customers are always sent to the server where their session is stored.
A disadvantage of an active-passive system is scalability. This is where an active-active system shines. With both servers available, the second server can take some load for the application, and the entire system can take more load. However, if the application is stateful, there would be an issue if the customer’s session isn’t available on both servers. Stateless applications work better for active-active systems.
