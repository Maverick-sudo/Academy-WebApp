5.  Amazon RDS is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud. With a relational database management system (RDBMS), you can create, update, and administer a relational database. Use cases for RDBMS include applications that have a fixed schema, applications that need persistent storage. Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) to store and query data. This approach allows data to be stored in an easily understandable, consistent, and scalable way. AWS RDS is a managed service that automates tasks i.e patching, backups, redundancy, failover, disaster recovery, all of which you normally have to manage for yourself. This makes it an extremely attractive option to AWS customers, as it allows you to focus on business problems and not maintaining databases.. With these capabilities, you can spend less time completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications. You can integrate Amazon RDS with other services to fulfill your business and operational needs, such as using AWS Lambda to query your database from a serverless application. Amazon RDS provides a number of different security options. Many Amazon RDS database engines offer encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored) and encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received). Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O). Amazon RDS is built from compute and storage. The compute portion is called the database (DB) instance, which runs the DB engine. Depending on the engine selected, the instance will have different supported features and configurations. A DB instance can contain multiple databases with the same engine, and each DB can contain multiple tables. Underneath the DB instance is an EC2 instance. However, this instance is managed through the Amazon RDS console instead of the Amazon EC2 console. When you create your DB instance, you choose the instance type and size. The DB instance class you choose affects how much processing power and memory it has. 
The storage portion of DB instances for Amazon RDS use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage. The storage portion of DB instances for Amazon RDS use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes for database and log storage. This includes third-party supported database engines MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. When using Aurora, data is stored in cluster volumes, which are single, virtual volumes that use solid-state drives (SSDs). A cluster volume contains copies of your data across three Availability Zones in a single AWS Region. For nonpersistent, temporary files, Aurora uses local storage.

In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS creates a redundant copy of your database in another Availability Zone. You end up with two copies of your database—a primary copy in a subnet in one Availability Zone and a standby copy in a subnet in a second Availability Zone. The primary copy of your database provides access to your data so that applications can query and display the information. The data in the primary copy is synchronously replicated to the standby copy. The standby copy is not considered an active database, and it does not get queried by applications.

To improve availability, Amazon RDS Multi-AZ ensures that you have two copies of your database running and that one of them is in the primary role. If an availability issue arises, such as the primary database loses connectivity, Amazon RDS initiates an automatic failover.
When you create a DB instance, a Domain Name System (DNS) name is provided. AWS uses that DNS name to fail over to the standby database. In an automatic failover, the standby database is promoted to the primary role, and queries are redirected to the new primary database. To help ensure that you don't lose Multi-AZ configuration, there are two ways you can create a new standby database. They are as follows:
    Demote the previous primary to standby if it's still up and running.
    Stand up a new standby DB instance.
The reason you can select multiple subnets for an Amazon RDS database is because of the Multi-AZ configuration. You will want to ensure that you have subnets in different Availability Zones for your primary and standby copies.
Use IAM policies to assign permissions that determine who can manage Amazon RDS resources. For example, you can use IAM to determine who can create, describe, modify, and delete DB instances, tag resources, or modify security groups.
Use security groups to control which IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances can connect to your databases on a DB instance. When you first create a DB instance, all database access is prevented except through rules specified by an associated security group.
Use Amazon RDS encryption to secure your DB instances and snapshots at rest.
Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections with DB instances running the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server database engines.

6.  AWS DynamoDB is a non-relational database. Non-relational databases tend to have simple flexible schemas, not complex rigid schemas, laying out multiple tables that all relate to each other. With DynamoDB, you can add and remove attributes from items in the table, at any time. Not every item in the table has to have the same attributes. This is great for datasets that have some variation from item to item. Because of this flexibility, you cannot run complex SQL queries on it. Instead, you would write queries based on a small subset of attributes that are designated as keys. Because of this, the queries that you run are non-relational databases tend to be simpler, and focus on a collection of items from one table, not queries than span multiple tables. This query pattern, along with other factors, including the way that the underlying system is designed, allows DynamoDB to be very quick in response time, and highly scalable. DynamoDB is a non-relational, NoSQL database It is purpose built. Meaning it has specific use cases, and it isn't the best fit for every workload out there. It has millisecond response time. It's fully managed, and it's highly scalable.
Create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. In NOSQL DB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components that you work with. A table is a collection of items(Items in NoSQL are similar in many ways to rows, records, or tuples in other database systems), and each item is a collection of attributes(Attributes in NoSQL are similar in many ways to fields or columns in other database systems). DynamoDB uses primary keys to uniquely identify each item in a table and secondary indexes to provide more querying flexibility.
DynamoDB provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies. They include the following:
DynamoDB provides a highly durable storage infrastructure designed for mission-critical and primary data storage. Data is redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities in a DynamoDB Region.  
All user data stored in DynamoDB is fully encrypted at rest. DynamoDB encryption at rest provides enhanced security by encrypting all your data at rest using encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).
IAM administrators control who can be authenticated and authorized to use DynamoDB resources. You can use IAM to manage access permissions and implement security policies.
As a managed service, DynamoDB is protected by the AWS global network security procedures.
Azure Table storage stores large amounts of structured data. Azure tables are a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. This enables you to use Azure tables to build your hybrid or multicloud solution and have your data always available. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.

7.  Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.. This is data warehousing as a service. Data warehouses are engineered specifically for this kind of big data, where you are looking at historical analytics as opposed to operational analysis. It's massively scalable. Redshift nodes in multiple petabyte sizes is very common. In fact, in cooperation with Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can directly run a single SQL query against exabytes of unstructured data running in data lakes. But it's more than just being able to handle massively larger data sets. Redshift uses a variety of innovations that allow you to achieve up to 10 times higher performance than traditional databases, when it comes to these kinds of business intelligence workloads.
