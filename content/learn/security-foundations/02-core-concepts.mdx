Security fundamentals are decision tools. They help you pick the right control for the right problem, and explain why it matters.

## CIA and beyond

The CIA triad is the baseline:

- **Confidentiality:** who is allowed to see it.
- **Integrity:** who is allowed to change it.
- **Availability:** when it must work.

Common extensions you should keep in mind:

- **Authenticity:** is this user, service, or message real.
- **Accountability:** can actions be traced to an identity.
- **Non-repudiation:** can an actor credibly deny an action.
- **Privacy:** are you collecting and using data appropriately.

Most security controls are trade-offs. If you improve confidentiality, you may add friction or cost and impact availability. Being explicit about the trade makes you faster and safer.

## Core principles

### Defense in depth

Do not bet the system on one control. Layer controls so that a single failure is not catastrophic.

Examples:

- Authentication plus authorization plus network segmentation
- Input validation plus output encoding plus CSP
- Backups plus immutable logs plus incident runbooks

### Least privilege

Give identities the minimum permissions needed, for the minimum time, scoped to the minimum resources.

Patterns:

- Separate admin and daily accounts
- Use role-based access rather than shared credentials
- Prefer short-lived credentials and just-in-time elevation

### Secure defaults

Systems should be safe when nobody touches them.

Examples:

- Deny by default firewall rules
- Private by default storage buckets
- MFA required for privileged actions

### Reduce attack surface

If you do not need it, do not expose it.

- Remove unused ports and services
- Disable legacy protocols
- Minimize third-party dependencies

### Observability and feedback

You cannot defend what you cannot see.

- Log security-relevant events
- Alert on high-signal changes
- Measure and review regularly

## Translating principles into decisions

When you face a design choice, answer these questions:

1. What asset are we protecting.
2. What is the likely threat and failure mode.
3. Which CIA property is most important here.
4. What control reduces risk the most per unit of complexity.
5. How will we know the control is working.
