title: Introduction to Security Foundations
description: Establish the scope, goals, and study flow for the course.
---

Security work starts with a clear understanding of what you are protecting, who might want it, and what failure would look like. Tools change. Principles, trade-offs, and good operational habits scale.

<Callout title="What you will do" tone="info">
- Build a security-first way of thinking, not just a checklist.
- Learn how to reason about risk and choose controls.
- Practice turning abstract principles into concrete engineering decisions.
</Callout>

## What "security" means in practice

At a minimum, you are trying to preserve:

- **Confidentiality:** prevent unauthorized disclosure.
- **Integrity:** prevent unauthorized modification.
- **Availability:** keep systems usable when needed.

Most real systems also require **authenticity** (knowing something is genuine) and **accountability** (being able to trace actions). You will see these ideas reappear in identity, logging, change management, and incident response.

## A simple mental model

Think in four nouns:

- **Assets:** what has value (data, credentials, systems, uptime, reputation).
- **Threats:** who or what could cause harm (attackers, insiders, mistakes, outages).
- **Vulnerabilities:** weaknesses that make harm easier (bugs, misconfigurations, missing controls).
- **Controls:** what reduces likelihood or impact (technical, operational, managerial).

You do not need a perfect model to start. You need a repeatable one.

## Course flow

1. **Define objectives**: what matters most for this system.
2. **Set scope and constraints**: what you can and cannot change.
3. **Choose principles**: least privilege, defense in depth, secure defaults.
4. **Apply to scenarios**: take one decision at a time (auth, storage, network, deploy).
5. **Operationalize**: logging, patching, incident readiness.

## How to study (recommended)

- Read each chapter once for vocabulary.
- Re-read with a concrete system in mind (a homelab, a web app, a cloud account).
- For every concept, answer: "What would I change in a real environment?"

<Callout title="Check yourself" tone="warning">
If you can only describe tools, but not outcomes (what risk is reduced and why), anchor back to objectives and trade-offs.
