description: Apply security thinking to threat modeling, architecture review, IR readiness, and risk prioritization.
---

Advanced topics extend the same core ideas into modern architectures and threat models. This chapter prepares you to tackle structured security thinking beyond configuration: how to model threats, review designs, prepare for incidents, and prioritize limited security resources.

## Threat modeling

Threat modeling is how you answer "What could go wrong?" before you build or deploy something. It is not a penetration test. It is structured paranoia.

### Why it matters

- Catches design flaws before they ship.
- Aligns security with product decisions.
- Identifies what is worth protecting and from whom.

### Common frameworks

**STRIDE** (Microsoft) categorizes threats by type:

- **Spoofing:** attacker impersonates a user or service
- **Tampering:** unauthorized modification of data or code
- **Repudiation:** denial of performing an action
- **Information Disclosure:** exposure of confidential data
- **Denial of Service:** making a system unavailable
- **Elevation of Privilege:** gaining unauthorized access level

**PASTA** (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) is risk-centric, focusing on business impact.

**Attack Trees** map ways an attacker could achieve a goal.

STRIDE is good for feature-level threat modeling. PASTA is better for aligning business risk with engineering. Attack trees work well for specific high-value scenarios. Use what fits your team and scope.

### How to do it (practical)

1. **Define boundaries:** draw a diagram showing components, trust zones, and data flows.
2. **Enumerate threats:** for each boundary crossing or privileged component, ask: who might abuse this, and how?
3. **Rank by likelihood and impact:** not all threats deserve equal attention.
4. **Pick mitigations:** apply principles (least privilege, defense in depth, secure defaults).
5. **Document decisions:** explain what you mitigated, what you accepted, and why.

### Threat modeling checklist

When modeling a new system or major change:

- [ ] Identify assets (what has value)
- [ ] Identify attackers and their capabilities (insider, external, nation-state)
- [ ] Map trust boundaries (network zones, authentication levels, privilege tiers)
- [ ] Enumerate likely attacks per boundary
- [ ] For each threat: likelihood (Low/Med/High) and impact (Low/Med/High)
- [ ] Select controls or accept risk explicitly
- [ ] Review with stakeholders (security, engineering, product)

## Incident response (IR) readiness

Being ready for an incident is more valuable than having perfect prevention. Incidents will happen. The goal is to minimize blast radius and recovery time.

### Core IR phases

**Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned**

Most failures happen in Preparation and Detection.

### What readiness looks like

- **Runbooks:** step-by-step playbooks for common scenarios (compromised credentials, DDoS, data leak, ransomware).
- **On-call rotation:** clear escalation paths and contact lists.
- **Backup validation:** test restore procedures quarterly.
- **Log retention:** retain logs long enough to investigate (90 days minimum for security-relevant logs).
- **Tooling:** pre-authorized access to forensic tools, EDR, SIEM.
- **Communication plan:** who talks to customers, press, legal, regulators.

### IR readiness checklist

- [ ] Defined roles (Incident Commander, Comms Lead, Tech Lead)
- [ ] Runbooks for top 5 incident scenarios
- [ ] Logging enabled for authentication, authorization, and privileged actions
- [ ] Centralized log aggregation and retention
- [ ] Contact list (internal team, legal, PR, third-party IR vendors)
- [ ] Tested restore procedure from backups
- [ ] Post-incident review template

<Callout title="Test your IR" tone="warning">
Run tabletop exercises quarterly. Walk through scenarios like "attacker has read access to production DB" or "leaked API keys on GitHub." You will find gaps.
</Callout>

## Secure architecture review

Architecture reviews catch security problems early when they are cheap to fix. This is not a penetration test or a compliance audit. It is a structured conversation about design decisions.

### What to review

- Authentication and authorization flows
- Secrets management (how are credentials stored and rotated)
- Network segmentation (is the database directly internet-accessible?)
- Data classification and encryption (at rest, in transit, in use)
- Logging and monitoring (what gets logged, where, and for how long)
- Deployment and CI/CD pipelines (who can push to production)

### Questions to ask

**Identity and access:**

- How do users authenticate? MFA enforced?
- How do services authenticate to each other?
- What is the blast radius of a compromised credential?
- Can actions be traced to an identity?

**Data:**

- What data is sensitive? How is it classified?
- Where is it encrypted (in transit, at rest)?
- Who can decrypt it?
- Are backups encrypted and tested?

**Network:**

- What trust boundaries exist (VPC, subnets, security groups)?
- Are privileged services isolated from public internet?
- Is egress traffic monitored and filtered?

**Operations:**

- Who can deploy to production?
- Are infrastructure changes reviewed before applying?
- How are secrets rotated?
- Are logs centralized and tamper-evident?

### Architecture review checklist

- [ ] Diagram trust zones and data flows
- [ ] Identify critical assets and high-value targets
- [ ] Verify least privilege for identities and services
- [ ] Confirm secrets are not in code or logs
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- [ ] Validate logging covers authn/authz/privileged actions
- [ ] Review deployment and change management controls
- [ ] Document residual risks explicitly

## Risk prioritization (triage)

You have limited time, budget, and engineering resources. Not all security work is equal. Prioritize by likelihood, impact, and ease of exploitation.

### Prioritization framework

Use a simple 3x3 matrix:

**Likelihood: Low | Medium | High**  
**Impact: Low | Medium | High**

**Critical (High likelihood + High impact):**

- Address immediately.
- Example: unpatched RCE vulnerability in internet-facing service.

**High (High likelihood OR High impact):**

- Schedule within current sprint.
- Example: missing MFA on admin accounts.

**Medium (Medium likelihood + Medium impact):**

- Backlog for next quarter.
- Example: outdated TLS cipher suites.

**Low (Low likelihood + Low impact):**

- Accept or defer.
- Example: theoretical side-channel on non-sensitive data.

### Common mistakes

- Treating all CVEs as equal (vendor severity != your risk)
- Ignoring operational risks (weak backups, no runbooks)
- Over-indexing on compliance checkboxes
- Under-investing in detection and response

<Callout title="Risk prioritization checklist" tone="info">
For each vulnerability or control gap:
1. What asset is at risk?
2. What is the attacker capability required?
3. What is the blast radius if exploited?
4. What is the cost of remediation?
5. Can the risk be reduced another way (detection, response, isolation)?
</Callout>

### Example prioritization

| Issue | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Unpatched internet-facing SSH service | High | High | **Critical** | Actively scanned; RCE leads to full compromise |
| No MFA on admin accounts | High | High | **Critical** | Credential stuffing is common; admin access = full control |
| Logs retained for only 7 days | Med | Med | **High** | Limits incident investigation; easy fix |
| Missing DNSSEC | Low | Low | **Low** | Theoretical; no active attacks observed |

## Key takeaways

- Threat modeling identifies design flaws before they ship.
- IR readiness reduces incident blast radius and recovery time.
- Architecture reviews catch systemic security problems early.
- Risk prioritization ensures you work on what matters most.

Security is not about being perfect. It is about being deliberate. Model threats. Prepare for incidents. Review designs. Prioritize ruthlessly.
