PERFORMING INCIDENT RESPONSE

Incident Response means investigating the alerts captured by the monitoring systems and issues reported by teams.
A very critical security function for a security professional.

• Ensure to summarize the phases of incident handling.
• Utilize appropriate data sources to assist an investigation.
• Apply mitigation techniques to secure the environment after an event.
• Effective incident response is governed by formal policies and procedures, setting out roles and responsibilities for an IR team.

---

PREPARATION

Incident Response policy sets the resources, processes, and guidelines for dealing with security incidents.
A vital task to mitigating risk incident impact, as well as controlling the immediate specific threat to security.
Effective incident response preserves organizational reputation.

NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, Special Publication 800-61, sets out principal stages and an incident response lifecycle.
A well-defined lifecycle consists of multiple phases.

PHASES OF INCIDENT RESPONSE LIFECYCLE

• Preparation
• Identification
• Containment
• Eradication
• Recovery
• Post-Incident Activity

---

1. Preparation:
   • Make the system resilient to attack in the first place.
   • Hardening the system.
   • Creating policies and procedures.
   • Setting up consistent lines of communication.
   • Creating the required resources and procedures.

2. Identification:
   • Derived from information in alerts and report logs.
   • Determining if an incident has taken place.
   • Assess how severe it might be (triage).
   • Notify stakeholders.

3. Containment:
   • Limit the scope and magnitude of the incident.
   • The principal aim is to secure data while limiting immediate impact on customers and business operations.

4. Eradication:
   • After the incident is contained, remove the cause.
   • Restore affected systems to a secure state.
   • Apply secure configuration settings.
   • Install patches and updates.

5. Recovery:
   • Reintegrating sanitized systems and networks back into business process workflows.
   • Restore data.
   • Prevent recurrence of the attack.

6. Lessons Learned / Post-Incident Activity:
   • Analyze the incident and responses.
   • Identify whether procedures or systems could be improved.
   • Imperative to document the incident.
   • Output feeds back into a new preparation cycle.

---

Incident Response often requires coordinated action and authorization from several departments, adding further levels of complexity.
Team members should be rotated periodically to reduce the possibility of insider infiltration.

One challenge is defining and categorizing types of incidents.
An incident is generally described as an event where security is breached or there is an attempted breach.
NIST describes an incident as:
“An act of violating an explicit or implied security policy.”

TRIAGE

To manage incidents, develop methods of reporting, categorizing, and prioritizing.
Some troubleshooting support incidents can be logged similarly.
A dedicated team serves as a single point of contact for notifications.

Security incident response teams include:
• SIRT – Security Incident Response Team
• CERT – Computer Emergency Response Team
• CIRT – Computer Incident Response Team
• SOC-based Incident Response Teams

These teams require a mixture of trained senior decision-makers who can authorize actions for serious incidents, and administrators and technicians who handle minor incidents.
For major incidents, expertise from other business divisions may be required.

Key Supporting Functions:
• Legal – Evaluate IR from a compliance and regulatory perspective; liaison with law enforcement; impacts on employees.
• Human Resources – Contracts, employee monitoring rights, mediation of negative impacts.
• Marketing / PR – Managing publicity from serious incidents effectively.

Availability:
IR teams require 24/7 availability, which is expensive; some organizations outsource to third-party incident response providers.
External agents may deal more effectively with insider threats.

---

IR POLICIES & COMMUNICATIONS

IR policies define clear lines of communication:
• Reporting incidents
• Notifying affected parties
• Preventing inadvertent release of information

Trusted parties authorized to handle incidents must be identified.
Status and event details should be circulated on a need-to-know basis.

Stakeholders may include authorities and affected parties.
Consider obligations to report attacks promptly.
Maintain a document listing internal contacts for notification and collaboration.
Consider monitoring and PR impact of incidents.
Demonstrate to customers that systems have improved.

Out-of-Band Communications:
• Communication methods that cannot be intercepted by adversaries.
• Do not alert adversaries to detection and remediation actions.
• Do not use compromised communication channels.
• Use separate systems for file/data exchange.
• Use digital signatures and encryption keys.
• End-to-end encryption or off-the-record (OTR) systems.
• Ensure email systems support message encryption (S/MIME, PGP).
• Do not release privileged information to untrusted parties.

Incident Response fits into overall Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and cybersecurity resilience.

---

INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

Defines procedures, contacts, and resources available for various incident categories.
IR teams develop profiles and scenarios of typical incidents.
These guide prioritization and remediation.

Playbooks:
• Checklists of actions to detect and respond to specific incidents.
• Runbooks – SOAR-integrated operational procedures.

Incident categories and definitions ensure shared understanding among response team members.
Definitions may vary by industry.

---

INCIDENT PRIORITIZATION FACTORS

• Data Integrity – Value of data at risk.
• Downtime – Degree of business disruption.
• Asset Inventory and Risk Assessment.
• Incidents may degrade or interrupt availability.
• Scope – Number of systems affected (not always priority indicator).
• Publicity – Short-term IR costs and lost opportunities.
• Economic Impact – Long-term reputational damage.
• Detection Time – Speed of detection and response.
• Recovery Time – Length of remediation and restoration.

Extended recovery periods can reduce alertness and control effectiveness.

THREAT INTELLIGENCE & FRAMEWORKS

Effective Incident Response depends on threat intelligence and threat research.

LOCKHEED MARTIN CYBER KILL CHAIN

1. Reconnaissance – Gathering information on targets, personnel, systems, and supply chain.
2. Weaponization – Coupling payload code with exploit.
3. Delivery – Transmitting payload to the target environment.
4. Exploitation – Executing weaponized code.
5. Installation – Installing malware or RAT to achieve persistence.
6. Command and Control (C2) – Establishing outbound channel to adversary-controlled server.
7. Actions on Objectives – Data exfiltration or other goals.

---

DIGITAL FORENSICS

Techniques to collect and preserve evidence demonstrating no tampering or manipulation.
Forensic procedures are detailed and time-consuming, while IR is usually urgent.
If forensic collection is required, it must be specified early.

Retention Policy:
Important for retrospective incident handling and threat hunting.
Defines how long logs and data are retained.
Without retention, later investigations may be impossible.

---

UTILIZING APPROPRIATE DATA SOURCES

Incident identification involves prioritizing and investigating urgent alerts.
