### EMBEDDED SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY

An embedded system is a complete system designed to perform a specific, dedicated function within a **Static Environment** (whereas a PC is a **Dynamic Environment**).

* **Static Environment:** Requires/does not allow or require frequent changes. In terms of security, this can be ideal as unchanging environments are typically easier to protect and defend.
* Functionality can be found in consumer devices and industrial devices (**IoT**).
* Constrained by **processor capability** (cores and speed), **system memory** (low), and **low persistent storage**.
* Characterized by predictable processing workloads and time-sensitive operations.

#### Hardware Architecture: PC vs. Embedded

* **PC Hardware:** **Root of Trust** in a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** is an **Explicit Trust Anchor**.
* **Embedded Networks:** **Root of Trust** is often implied. Based on an **Implied Trust Model**, any device added to the network is trusted by the administrator.

| Feature | Desktop PC Architecture | Embedded System Architecture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Components** | Generalized CPU, processors, controllers, I/O, system memory linked via **Motherboard**. | **System on Chip (SoC)** design where all components are on a **single processor DIE or microchip**. |
| **Efficiency** | High compute resource usage. | Microchip packaging is space and power efficient (e.g., **Raspberry Pi**, **Arduino**). |
| **Specialization** | General purpose. | **Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)** or **Microcontrollers**. |

* **Microcontroller:** A processing unit capable of performing sequential operations from a dedicated instruction set determined by the vendor at the time of manufacture. Software is converted to dedicated instructions by **Assembly Language**.
* **Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA):** A type of microcontroller with no default dedicated instruction set at the time of manufacture. The end administrator can configure the programming logic of the device to run specific applications.

### OPERATING SYSTEMS & CONSTRAINTS

* **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** Embedded systems use OSs that are much more stable and reliable.
* **Baseband Firmware:** Used in cellular communication.
* **Performance Requirements:** Low tolerance for reboots, crashes, or lagging.
* **Latency and Reliability:** Tend to be more important than high data rates. **RTOS** have fast response times predictable to microsecond tolerance.
* **Security:** **RTOS** have as small an attack surface as possible but are still susceptible to **CVEs** and exploits.

#### Power and Connectivity Constraints

* **Smartphones:** WiFi/5G/4G are power-hungry, requiring antennas to maximize data rates, range, and bandwidth.
* **Embedded Systems:** Rely on power-efficient data transfer of small amounts of data with high reliability and low power consumption.
* Lack of compute resources often leads to a lack of security options like **Authentication** and **Identification** tools. This prompts the development of **Lightweight Ciphers** (low key size/digest) that don't require large processing resources.

### COMMUNICATIONS CONSIDERATIONS

There is a need for closer integration with IT networks using standardized communication technology.

* **Operational Technology (OT) Networks:** Refers to cabled networks for industrial applications.
* Use **Serial Data** protocols or **Industrial Ethernet**.
* Optimized for real-time deterministic transfers.


* **Layer 2 Switching:** Ethernet switching performs Layer 2 switching only.
* **Cellular Networks:** Facilitate long-distance communications.
* **Baseband Radio:** Managed by a baseband processor acting as a cellular modem.
* **Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT):** A low-power version of 4G LTE.
* **LTE Machine Type Communication (LTE-M):** Compatible with 5G networks and does not interfere with 5G signaling. Use 5G tower relays.


* **Microwave Radio Networks:** Cellular networks are essentially microwave radio networks.

### LTE AND CELLULAR RADIO

LTE-based **Cellular Radio** uses a **SIM** (Subscriber Identity Module) as an identifier.

* **NB-IoT** / **LTE-M** devices use the same function.
* An **eSIM** (embedded SIM) incorporates the identifier as a chip on the System Board.
* Encryption of frames between the Cell Tower and Endpoint is the responsibility of the network operator.
* **Over-the-Air Encryption** is performed by encryption schemes defined by the cellular standard.
* **Backhaul Security** (encryption from the network backhaul to internal routers) is usually enforced by **IPsec**.
* Network and Application layer security should be used for added security.

---

### ZIGBEE AND Z-WAVE

Wireless communication protocols used in creating **Mesh Topologies** with low power/low data rate requirements.

* **Zigbee:** Based on the **IEEE 802.15.4** standard.
* **Z-Wave:** Uses low-energy radio waves.
* Both have communications encryption. The main threats are:
* **Re-pairing Attacks:** Allows a threat actor to discover the network key by forcing a device off the network, causing it to try to re-connect (similar to De-auth attacks on IP networks).
* **Rogue Devices:** Unauthorized devices connected to the network systems.

### INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS (ICS)

* Industrial processes prioritize **Availability** and **Integrity** over **Confidentiality**—reversing the **CIA Triad**.
* **ICS** provide mechanisms for workflow and process automation.
* These systems control machinery in **Critical Infrastructure**.
* **Data Transfer** occurs via **Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** communications.

#### ICS Components

* **Distributed Control System (DCS):** An **ICS** that manages process automation within a single site.
* **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs):** Plant devices and equipment embedded with **PLCs**.
* **Fieldbus:** A serial network used in **Operational Technology (OT)** to link **PLCs**.
* **Industrial Ethernet:** Used to link **PLCs** and connect to **Actuators** and **Smart Devices** (Valves, motors, circuit breakers, sensors).
* **Human-Machine Interface (HMI):** Used for output configurations and monitoring of a **PLC**.
* **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):** Takes the place of a control server in large-scale multi-site **ICS**.
* Typically runs as software on ordinary PCs.
* Uses **WAN** communications.
* Gathers data from and manages plant devices and equipment (referred to as **Field Devices**, **Nodes**, or **Sensors**).



#### ICS Application Sectors

* **Power Generation & Energy Distribution.**
* **Industrial:** Refineries and mining.
* **Fabrication & Manufacturing/Assembling.**
* **Logistics.**
* **Facilities:** Building Management Systems (BMS), HVAC.

* Each "thing" is identified with a **Unique Serial Number** or code embedded within the hardware.
* Able to inter-operate within existing infrastructure either directly or via an intermediary hub or control system.
* **IoT devices are Headless** (no local interface).
* **Sensors:** Measure temperature, humidity, light levels, pressure, motion, proximity, gas, smoke, heart/breathing rates, etc.
* Examples: Thermocouples, Thermistors, Infrared Detectors, Inductive Coils, Photoelectric Cells, Capacitive Cells, Accelerometers, Gyroscopes.

### SECURITY FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

1. **Network Segmentation:** Network access for **IoT** environments should only be required to apply firmware updates.
2. **Wrappers:** Use of wrappers like **IPsec** for protecting traffic between trusted and untrusted networks.
3. **Programming Security:** Logic in **FPGA** must have no **backdoors**.
