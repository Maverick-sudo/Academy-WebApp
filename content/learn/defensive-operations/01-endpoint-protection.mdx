### ENDPOINT PROTECTION DEPLOYMENT

1. Configure management system to push the agent software and updates to all desktops and workstations.
2. Assign hosts to appropriate groups for policy assignments (different endpoints have different security requirements).
3. Test the different host group configuration settings to ensure that the expected range of threats is detected.
4. Use a monitoring dashboard to verify status across all network hosts. Apart from detection events, if the agent itself is missing or disabled, there should be an alert.

### NEXT GENERATION ENDPOINT PROTECTION

Where **EPP** provides mostly signature-based detection and prevention, **Next Generation Endpoint Protection** with **Automated Response** is focused on logging **Endpoint Observables** and **Indicators** combined with **Behavioral and Anomaly-Based Analysis**.

#### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)

Malware may evade detection by automated scans. **EDR** products aim not to prevent initial execution but to:

* Provide **Real-time** and historical visibility into the compromise.
* Contain the malware to a single host.
* Facilitate remediation of the host to its original state.
* Such agents are likely to be managed from a cloud portal and use **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning** to perform **User and Entity Behavior Analysis (UEBA)**.
* **Managed Detection and Response (MDR)** is a class of hosted security services.

#### Advanced Malware Tools

Tools like **Sysinternals** are used when symptoms are identified but the **AV** scanner or **EPP** agent does not report an infection. Further analysis of the host for malware uses advanced tools. Indicators include:

* Suspicious network connections.
* Unexplained activity or behavioral analysis of **SIEM** and **IDS** logs.

### SANDBOXING

A technique that isolates an untrusted host, app, script, or file in a segregated environment to conduct tests.

* **Sandbox Environments** intentionally limit interfaces with external files and hosts.
* Determine malicious activity of certain files.
* Determine the effect if run outside the sandbox and what dependencies it might require.
* Sandboxes offer more than anti-malware alone because you can apply a variety of different environments to the sandbox instead of just relying on how the malware might exist in your current configuration.

### NEXT GENERATION FIREWALL INTEGRATION

An analytics-driven **Next-Gen Antivirus** product is likely to combine with the perimeter and local security offered by **Next-Gen Firewalls**.

* **Example:** Detecting a threat on an endpoint would automate a firewall policy to block the covert channel at the zone, isolate the endpoint, and mitigate risks of the malware spreading.
