Cabling is the backbone of any network infrastructure, providing the physical medium for data transmission. Proper cabling ensures reliable and high-performance network operations. This chapter delves into the various standards and types of cabling, focusing on Ethernet (copper) and Fibre Optic cabling. Ethernet cabling, primarily copper-based, is widely used for local area networks (LANs) due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of installation. Different categories of Ethernet cables support varying speeds and distances.

**IEEE 802.3 Standards** are the most important Ethernet specifications for effectively deploying wired LANs. Ethernet dominates the wired LAN market due to ease of installation and upgradability.

All Networking Signals use EM Radiation of one type or another, such as:
* Electric Current (Copper Cabling)
* Infrared Light (Fibre Optic)
* Radio Waves (Wireless)

Taking advantage of wave characteristics, signals are transmitted over the wave by modulation & encoding schemes. An example of encoding is transitioning between low to high voltage states in an electrical circuit, which in turn encodes digital info as 0, 1 data bits.


### Copper vs. Fibre Optic

**Copper Cable** transmits Electrical Signals using low voltage circuits between connected nodes in a circuit. It suffers from high **Attenuation** (i.e., signals lose strength over long distances).

**Fibre Optics**, on the other hand, carries very high frequency radiation in the Infrared light part of the EM spectrum. The light signals are not susceptible to outside noise interference and are less affected by attenuation, supporting higher bandwidth over longer links than copper cabling.


### Ethernet Naming Conventions

**`XGBase-Y`**

* `X`: Bit Rate in Mbps or Gbps (e.g., 10, 100, 1000, 10G, 40G).
* `Base`: Baseband (all Ethernet transmission is Baseband, meaning the entire frequency range is used for one signal at a time, versus broadband which divides the frequency).
* `Broadband`: Multiple frequencies sharing the same medium of connectivity. Common in Fiber Optic.
* `Y`: Media type designator (e.g., `T` for Twisted Pair, `SX` for Short wavelength multimode fiber, `LX` for Long wavelength multimode fiber).


### Ethernet Standards & Deployment

* **10 Base-T:** Standard dates from 1990. Unlikely to be deployed in modern LANs. Mostly used in SOHO networks and for maintaining legacy networks.
* **100 Base-Tx (Fast Ethernet):** Mostly used in SOHO Networks and for maintaining legacy networks.
* **Gigabit Ethernet (1000Base-T):** Used in mainstream offices to connect common workstations.
* **10G/40G Base-T:** Not really deployed in access networks as the cost for compatible network adapters and switch transceiver modules is high. Used in conglomerates, business centers, data centers, due to its high throughput.

### Bandwidth

**Bandwidth** refers to the frequency range measured in cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). In networking, this means the amount of data transferred, measured in bits per second (bps). For a signal with 100MHz frequency bandwidth, it can transfer much more than 100 Mbps. Due to the higher frequency required, sometimes this can cause interference. Therefore, shielding is required for longer distance Fibre Optic runs.

### Media Access Control and Collision Domains

Since Ethernet is a multiple access area network (i.e., available communication capacity is shared between nodes connected to the same medium of transmission), the **Media Access Control (MAC)** refers to the method a network technology uses to determine when nodes communicate in shared media and to deal with possible issues of two devices communicating simultaneously.

Each network node connected to the same media is said to be in the **Same Collision Domain**.

### CSMA/CD

**Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)** is a protocol governing media access. A **collision** is a state when signals are present in an interface's transmit and receive lines simultaneously. On detecting a collision, the node broadcasts a Jam Signal. Every other node attempts a Backed-off wait for a random period before attempting to retransmit again. This mechanism means only half-duplex transmission is possible (Transmit OR Receive, but NOT BOTH simultaneously).


### Twisted Pair Cabling

* **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** Pairs of wires are twisted together to form a balanced circuit, carrying the same signals but with different polarity. The wires are twisted at different rates to reduce external interference and crosstalk.
* **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) / Screened Twisted Pair (SSTP):** Less susceptible to interference & crosstalk. Used mostly in environments with high levels of interference.
    * **F/UTP (Foiled/Unshielded Twisted Pair):** Overall foil shield, unshielded twisted pairs.
    * **U/FTP (Unshielded/Foiled Twisted Pair):** Unshielded overall, foiled twisted pairs.
    * **S/FTP (Shielded/Foiled Twisted Pair):** Shielded overall, foiled twisted pairs.
    * **F/FTP (Foiled/Foiled Twisted Pair):** Overall foil shield, foiled twisted pairs.

Using screened or shielded cable means that you must also use screened or shielded connectors. Their elements should not be mixed with unscreened/unshielded elements.

### Twisted Pair Connectors

* **F-Connector (Coaxial):** Used in cable television, commonly with RG-6 cable.
* **RJ-45 (8P8C - 8 Position, 8 Conductor):** Registered Jack. Supplied in pairs of 4 (8 wires). Most commonly installed type of wiring for data.
* **RJ-25 (6P6C):** 6 potential ports of contact, supplied with 3 pairs (6 wires).
* **RJ-14 (6P4C):** 6 potential ports of contact, supplied with 2 pairs (4 wires). Used in dual-line telephone/DSL.
* **RJ-11 (6P2C):** 6 potential ports of contact, supplied with 1 pair (2 wires). Used in single-line telephone/DSL.
* **GG45 / TERA:** Used in data centers, for higher performance.

### Cabling Fire Safety Ratings

A **Plenum space** is an air-handling space in a building (e.g., false ceilings, raised floors). This space can be used for telecommunications cabling. Therefore, building regulations demand the use of fire-retardant **Plenum Cabling** in such places. Plenum cables must not emit large amounts of smoke when burned, be self-extinguishing, and meet other fire safety standards. (Compare with General Purpose (non-plenum) CM/CMR/CMP cables).

**Riser Cables** are passed through floors, in conduits or lift shafts.

---

### Coaxial & Twin-Axial Cable & Connectors

**Coaxial Cable** is categorized using Radio Grade (RG) Standards, which represent the thickness of the core conductor and the cable's characteristics. Coaxial means a cable made of 2 conductors that share the same axis. The core conductor is made of a copper core (solid or stranded, not twisted) and enclosed by plastic insulation. A wire mesh (second conductor) serves as both shielding from EMI and as a ground (earth) surrounding the insulating material. Coax is usually terminated using BNC connectors, securely screwed or crimped.

**Twin-Axial (Twinax)** is similar to coax but contains 2 twin conductors. Mostly used in data centers (10GbE and 40GbE) interconnects up to 5m for passive cable types and 10m for active cable types. Terminated using SFP+ Direct Attach Copper (DAC) and QSFP+ DAC transceivers.

**American Wire Gauge (AWG)** is a measure of wire thickness. Increasing AWG number represents thinner wire.

### Deploying Ethernet Cabling (ANSI/TIA/EIA 568 - Structured Cabling Standards)

These standards define classes of networking infrastructure.
* **International ISO/IEC 11801:** International cabling standards.
* **Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) standards:** US-centric cabling standards (e.g., ANSI/TIA/EIA 568).
Structured cabling is a scheme for deploying Ethernet cabling.

* **Work Area:** User space for equipment connected to the network, usually via a wall outlet.
* **Horizontal Cabling:** Connects user work areas to the nearest **Horizontal Cross-Connect (HCC)** / **Telecommunications Room (TR)**. Referred to as a "distribution frame." Consists of cabling from a single floor, made up of cables run horizontally through wall ducts.
* **Backbone Cabling:** Connecting Horizontal Cross-connects via Intermediate Cross-Connects (ICCs). Inside risers, elevator shafts, HVAC spaces referred to as Vertical cross-connects, running up and down between floors.
* **Telecommunications Room (TR):** Houses HCCs, essentially a termination point for the Horizontal Cabling along with a connection to backbone cabling.
* **Equipment Room:** Houses the main intermediate cross-connects, houses complex equipment such as switches, routers & modems.
* **Entrance Facilities / DEMARC POINT:** Required for the access provider's network and for inter-building communications, marking the point at which external cabling (outside plant) is joined to internal premises cabling.

### Cable Management Techniques & Tools for Ethernet (Copper Cabling)

These techniques ensure that cabling is reliable and easy to maintain.

Copper wire is terminated using a distribution frame or **Punchdown Block**. A punchdown block comprises a large number of Insulation-Displacement Connections (IDCs).

1.  **66 Block:** Used in distribution frames to terminate telephone cabling and legacy data applications (Pre-Cat 5).
    * *A Private Branch Exchange (PBX) is a telephone system serving local extensions of an office.*
2.  **110 Block:** A distribution frame supporting 100 MHz operation; Cat 5 and better.
3.  **BIX (NORTEL) & KRONE:** Other types of distribution frames.
4.  **Patch Panel / Patch Bay:** NOT a punchdown block, but a "forwarding" frame.

#### Patch Panel / Patch Bay

In data networks, numerous **MACs (Moves, Adds, Changes)** would require reterminating the wiring. A **Patch Panel** is a type of distribution block with IDCs on one side & pre-terminated RJ-45 modular ports on the other, allowing incoming & outgoing connections to be reconfigured by changing the Patch Cable Connections, which is much simpler than reterminating punchdown blocks.

The structured cabling forming a backbone is terminated at the back of the patch panel on the IDCs. An RJ-45 patch cord is used to connect the port to another network port, typically a switch port housed in the same rack.

Fixed cable is terminated using a **Punchdown Tool**, which fixes conductors into an IDC. Different formats for IDCs (66, 110, BIX & KRONE) all require different cutting blades. Blades are double-sided: one side pushes the core into the terminal while the other side cuts excess.

A **Patch Cord** is created using a **Cable Crimper**, which fixes a plug to a cable. The boots are specific to the type of connector and cable, though some may have modular dies to support a range of RJ type plugs.

You must untwist the ends of the wire pairs (no more than 0.375") and place them into the connector die in the correct order for the wiring configuration (T568A or T568B) you want. For shielded/screened cable, termination must be made to shielded RJ-45 or modular plugs. A shielded modular plug has a metal housing and is not terminated using a standard cable crimper.

This entire note is Cable Management for Copper Cabling Ethernet. Next, we will look into Fiber Distribution Panels.

### Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

**Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)** is a means of using a single fiber strand to transmit and/or receive more than one channel at a time. This involves Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs) which can insert or remove signals for a given wavelength. **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)** helps enable bi-directional communication over a single strand of fiber by using different wavelengths for each channel. This is achieved by combining multiple optical carriers into a single fiber.

* **Bi-directional Wavelength Division Multiplexing (Bidi WDM):** Transceivers support transmit and receive signals over the same strand of fiber. They must be installed in opposite pairs. For example, a downstream transceiver would use 1490nm for transmit (Tx) and 1310nm for receive (Rx), while the upstream would use 1310nm for Tx and 1490nm for Rx. They are also documented in Ethernet standards like 1000Base-BX or 10GBase-BX.
* **Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM):** Supports up to 16 wavelengths and is typically used to deploy 4/8 bidirectional channels over a single strand of fiber.
* **Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM):** Provides greater numbers of channels (20, 40, 80, 160). This means less spacing between each channel and requires more precise and expensive optics.
    * CWDM & DWDM Transceivers support multi-channel 1G, 10G, 40G, 100G.
    * Each Transceiver in a Point-to-Point WDM Topology is cabled to a multiplexer/demultiplexer (Mux/Demux).

### Twisted Pair Copper Cabling

**Twisted Pairs** consist of two wires with equal and opposite signals (Transmit +, Transmit -, Receive +, Receive -). The twist provides advantages like **limited interference**. The pairs within the same cable have different twist rates, which helps in signal reconstruction by reducing crosstalk.

## Fiber Optic Cabling

**Optical Fiber** transmits data using light signals. Fiber Optic Cabling supports higher bandwidth over long distances than copper. Fiber Optic signals use Infrared pulses, which are not susceptible to interference or attenuation.

Both the **Cladding** and **Core** are made up of similar material, however, with different refractive indexes, so as to create a boundary that causes light to bounce back into the core via total internal reflection. The surrounding **buffer** is an outer protective plastic coating.

Each optic strand can only transfer light in a single direction at a time. Therefore, multiple strands are bundled together for transmission & reception simultaneously. Fiber Optic Cables are specified using the core/cladding size in microns, the composition (either Fiberglass rods or Kevlar plastic), and the mode of operation.

### Fiber Modes

* **Single Mode Fiber (SMF):** Characterized by a small core (5-10 microns), long wavelength laser light (1310nm → 1550nm). They support distances in cable runs of many kilometers and speeds up to 100 Gbps. Expensive to deploy.
    * **OS1 Grade:** For indoor use.
    * **OS2 Grade:** For outdoor deployment.
* **Multimode Fiber (MMF):** Characterized by a larger core (50-62.5 microns), short wavelength light (850nm-1300nm) transmitted in multiple waves of varying length. Doesn't support such high signaling speeds or long distances as SMF.
    * **OM1 (62.5 microns) / OM2 (50 microns):** Cables rated for 1Gbps and use LED light.
    * **OM3 / OM4 (50 micron core):** Designed for use with 850nm VCSEL (Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser) lasers, also referred to as Laser Optimized MMF (LOMMF). Not as powerful as solid-state lasers used in SMF.

### Fiber Connector Types

* **ST (Straight Tip):** Uses push & twist locking, mostly for multimode networks.
* **SC (Subscriber Connector):** Uses push/pull design, used in Single or Multimode Gigabit Ethernet.
* **LC (Lucent Connector):** Uses tabbed push/pull design, a small form factor connector widely used in 10GbE and 40GbE.
* **MTRJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack):** Uses a snap-in design for MMF.

Fibre Optics is used in backbone links in campus networks, data centers, and storage area networks due to the increased bandwidth for server interconnections.

---

### Fibre Optic Types

Fibre Optic is divided into Single Mode (SMF) and Multimode (MMF) types. MMF is characterized by the Optical Mode designators (OM1, OM2, OM3, OM4).

* **Single Mode Fiber (SMF):** Simple, single frequency transmitted.
* **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF):** Multiple different frequency ranges transmitted.

**Comparison:** Fibre gives better upgrade potential in the future, while copper is cheaper to install, and more hosts are installed with network cards supporting copper than fiber.


### Advantages of Optical Fiber

* **No Radio Frequency (RF) Signal:** This makes it very difficult to monitor or tap, enhancing security.
* **Immune to RF Interference:** Light signals are not affected by electromagnetic interference.
* **Signal Slow to Degrade:** Can be transmitted over very long distances without significant loss.

### Fiber Optic Diagram Components

1.  **Core:** The central part where light travels, made of glass or plastic with a high refractive index.
2.  **Cladding:** A thin layer around the core with a lower refractive index, which causes light to reflect back into the core, keeping it contained.
3.  **Buffer Coating:** An outer protective plastic coating providing mechanical protection.

#### Common Fibre Optic Connector Types

Different types of connectors are used to terminate fibre optic cables, each with specific applications and advantages.

| **ST (Straight Tip)** | 2.5               | Bayonet mount, typically used with multi-mode fiber.       | Older networks, campuses, military applications    | Twist-on/off mechanism, common with multi-mode.                     |
| **FC (Ferrule Connector)** | 2.5               | Screw-on locking mechanism, common in single-mode.         | Data communication, telecom, high-vibration environments | Provides high connection strength, often used in industrial settings. |
| **MPO/MTP (Multi-fiber Push-on/pull-off)** | N/A (Multi-fiber) | Multi-fiber connector housing 8, 12, 24, or more fibers.  | Data centers, backbone, high-density environments | Used for parallel optics, requires specialized tools.             |

### Challenges of Fiber Optics: Return Loss

Controlling light and applying the laws of physics are crucial at the physical contact (PC) points of connectors. **Return loss** refers to light reflected back to the source. This is resolved using different polishing techniques:

* **UPC (Ultra Polished Connectors):** High return loss but zero air gap.
* **APC (Angle Polished Connectors):** Lower return loss but generally has a slightly higher insertion loss than UPC.

### Fiber Distribution Panel and Fusion Splicing / Terminating Optic Fibre

Because continually reconnecting fiber optic cables risks wear & tear damage, and to avoid replacing cable runs through conduit, permanent cables are run through conduit walls to wall posts at the access area end and to a **Fiber Distribution Panel** at the switch end.

Fiber patch cables are used to complete the link from the wall post to the NIC, and from the patch panel to the switch port.

A **Fusion Splice** achieves a more permanent join with lower insertion loss. The Fusion splicing machine performs a precise alignment between the two strands and then permanently joins them together using heat; the strands are welded. A High precision instrument must be kept clean & maintained following guidelines.

# Chapter 8: DEVICE CATEGORIZATION

## Introduction to Network Devices

Network devices are the fundamental components that enable communication and data exchange within a computer network. They perform various functions, from simply extending a signal to intelligent routing and security. Understanding how these devices are categorized helps in designing, implementing, and troubleshooting networks effectively. Devices can be categorized based on their function, the OSI layer at which they primarily operate, or their role within a network's architecture.

### Categorization by OSI Layer

Network devices often operate predominantly at specific layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, influencing their functionality and interaction with data.

#### Layer 1 (Physical Layer) Devices

These devices operate at the lowest layer, dealing with the physical transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium. They are primarily concerned with the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional characteristics of the network.

A **Hub** acts like a multi-port repeater so that every port receives transmissions sent from any other port. Consequently, every hub port is part of the same shared media access area and within the same Collision Domain. All node interfaces are half-duplex, using the CSMA/CD protocol. The media bandwidth (10 Mbps / 100 Mbps) is shared between all nodes. When Ethernet is wired with a hub, there needs to be a means of distinguishing the Interface on an End system (Computer host / client) from the Interface on an Intermediate system (a HUB). The end system is referred to as **MDI (Medium-Dependent Interface)**. The interface on the hub is referred to as **MDI Crossover (MDI-X)**. This means that the Transmit (Tx) wires on the host connect to Receive (Rx) wires on the hub.
* **Hubs:**
    * **Function:** Connect multiple Ethernet devices together, making them act as a single network segment.
    * **Operation:** A "dumb" device that broadcasts incoming data to all connected ports. Creates a single collision domain.
    * **Modern Use:** Largely obsolete in modern networks, replaced by switches.
    * **Characteristics:** Half-duplex communication.

* **Repeater:** Overcomes the distance limitation by boosting a signal at some point along the cable run. This is a Layer 1 (Physical Layer) device.
    * The attenuation of signals passing over copper or fiber cable imposes a distance limitation on links. A link where the cable length exceeds the distance limitation may not achieve the required speed or become unreliable.
    * Repeaters are available for both copper & fiber links (Optical-Electrical-Optical Repeaters).

* **Media Converter:** When a repeater is used to transition from one Cable type to another, thereby connecting two cable segments of different types.
    * **Single Mode Fiber to Twisted Pair:** Powered devices that convert light signals from SMF cabling into electrical signals carried over a copper wire, or vice versa (via Ethernet network).
    * **Multimode Mode Fiber to Twisted Pair:** Converts light signals in MMF.
    * **Single Mode to Multimode Fiber:** These passive (unpowered) devices convert between the two Fiber Cabling types.


* **Transceivers**
A network might involve multiple types of Cabling. When this occurs, switches & Router equipment must be able to terminate different cable and connector types, and devices must convert from one media type to another. There are also Transceiver modules for Copper wire Cabling. In the past, Transceiver modules were based on the **Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC)** form factor, which used Subscriber Connector (SC) ports for Gigabit Ethernet. It has been replaced by **SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable)**, also known as **Mini-GBIC**. SFP uses LC connectors and is also designed for Gigabit Ethernet. **Enhanced SFP (SFP+)** is an updated specification to support 10GbE but still uses the LC form factor, with different modules to support various Ethernet standards. A transceiver is designed to support a specific wavelength. Transceivers must be installed as matched pairs.
The term **MSA (Multi-Source Agreement)** is intended to ensure that a transceiver from one vendor is compatible with the switch/router module of another vendor.
* The **Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP)** is a transceiver with a form factor of 4x1 Gigabit (4Gbps) links, typically aggregated to a single 4Gbps channel.
* The **Enhanced QSFP (QSFP+)** is designed to support the 40GbE standard by provisioning 4 x 10Gbps links, where four strands transmit and four are unused, to transmit a full-duplex 40Gbps link.
* **Transceiver** combines a Transmitter (Tx) and Receiver (Rx) in a single component.
    * **Function:** Provide a modular interface that matches network types to equipment. Enable physical layer signal conversion, converting between different media types (e.g., fiber to copper and back again). For example, if you have fiber, the switch provides copper ports via a transceiver.
    * **Operation:**
    * **Duplex Communication:** Typically uses two fibers (one for transmit, one for receive).
    * **Bi-directional Transceivers:** Allow traffic in both directions with a single fiber strand by using two different wavelengths, which reduces the number of fiber runs by half.
* **Transceiver Form Factors**
    * **SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable):** Also known as "mini-GBICs," these are compact hot-pluggable transceivers.
    * **SFP+ (Enhanced SFP):** Same size as SFP, however, supports longer bandwidth due to its higher frequency of transmission, commonly used for 10 Gigabit Ethernet.
    * **QSFP (Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable):** A 4-channel SFP, combining four 1 Gigabit/s links for a total of 4 Gbit/s.
    * **QSFP+ (Enhanced QSFP):** Designed for 40 Gigabit Ethernet (4x 10 Gbit/s channels). It combines four SFP+ into a single transceiver. Further enhancements are creating bi-directional QSFP and QSFP+ for increased efficiency over a single fiber run.

#### Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) Devices

These devices operate at the Data Link Layer, dealing with MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and frames. They provide error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer.

* **Bridges:**
A **Bridge** works at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2). It separates physical segments into collision domains.

An Ethernet Bridge establishes a connection between separate physical network segments while keeping all nodes in the same logical network (Broadcast Domain), thereby reducing the number of collisions caused by having too many nodes contending for access. By isolating these segments from each other, nodes in one domain do not slow down or contend with nodes in another domain.

An Ethernet Bridge builds a **MAC address table** in memory to track which addresses are associated with which of its ports. It's initially empty pre-initialization, but information is constantly added as the bridge listens to the connected segments. Entries are flushed out of the table after a period to ensure information remains current. If no record of a hardware address (MAC) exists or the frame is a broadcast/multicast, then the bridge floods the frame to all segments except for the source segment (acting like a Layer 1 HUB).

The **contention problem** (where the probability of collision increases and opportunity to transmit becomes less frequent as more devices access the shared medium) is improved by bridges but not fully resolved.
* **Bridges:**
    * **Function:** Connects two or more LAN segments, forwarding frames based on MAC addresses.
    * **Operation:** Similar to a two-port switch, it filters traffic between segments.
    * **Modern Use:** Largely replaced by multi-port switches.

* **Switches:**
The contention problem can be completely resolved by moving from a shared Ethernet System to **Switched Ethernet**, thereby replacing Hubs & Bridges. Switches perform the same function as bridges, but in a more granular way and support many more ports. Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE / 10GbE) cannot be deployed without switches.

Each Switch port is a separate **Collision Domain**. In effect, the switch establishes a point-to-point link between any two network nodes. This is referred to as **MICRO SEGMENTATION** (absence of segments).

As with a bridge, traffic on all switch ports is in the same **Broadcast Domain**, unless the switch is configured to use **Virtual LANs (VLANs)**.
* **Switches:**
    * **Function:** Connect network segments or devices, forwarding data frames only to the destination port based on MAC addresses.
    * **Operation:** Builds a MAC address table (CAM table) by learning the MAC addresses of connected devices. Reduces collision domains, creating microsegments.
    * **Characteristics:** Full-duplex communication. Can be managed (VLANs, QoS) or unmanaged.
    * **Common Types:**
        * **Unmanaged Switches:** Plug-and-play, no configuration.
        * **Managed Switches:** Allow configuration of VLANs, QoS, port security, Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), etc.


#### Layer 3 (Network Layer) Devices

These devices operate at the Network Layer, dealing with IP (Internet Protocol) addresses and packets. They are responsible for routing packets between different networks (IP subnets).

* **Routers:**
    * **Function:** Connects different IP networks (e.g., LAN to WAN, home network to internet). Forwards data packets between networks.
    * **Operation:** Uses IP addresses to determine the best path for packet delivery, maintaining routing tables.
    * **Characteristics:** Creates separate broadcast domains. Key for inter-network communication.
* **Layer 3 Switches:**
    * **Function:** A switch that incorporates routing capabilities. Can perform both Layer 2 switching and Layer 3 routing.
    * **Operation:** Routes traffic between VLANs (Inter-VLAN Routing) at high speed using specialized hardware.
    * **Use Cases:** High-performance campus networks where routing between multiple VLANs is needed.

#### Layer 4-7 (Transport to Application Layers) Devices

These devices operate at higher OSI layers, often performing complex functions that go beyond simple packet forwarding, examining data content, and managing application-level traffic.

* **Firewalls:** (As detailed in Chapter 5's concluding section)
    * **Function:** Enforces security policies, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.
    * **Operation:** Can inspect traffic at various layers, from packet headers (packet-filtering) to application content (application firewalls).
* **Load Balancers:**
    * **Function:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overload.
    * **Operation:** Improves application availability and responsiveness. Can operate at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) or Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).
* **Proxy Servers:**
    * **Function:** Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.
    * **Operation:** Can provide security (hiding client IP), caching (improving performance), and content filtering.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    * **Function:** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and known threats.
    * **Operation:** IDS detects and alerts; IPS detects and actively blocks/prevents threats.

### Categorization by Function/Role (Network Design)

Network devices can also be categorized based on their logical placement and role within a network's design, especially in hierarchical models (e.g., Cisco's three-tier model).

| Role/Function           | Typical Devices                                         | Key Features                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Access Layer Devices** | Layer 2 Switches (unmanaged or basic managed)           | Port security, VLAN assignments, PoE (Power over Ethernet).               |

| **Core Layer Devices** | High-end Layer 3 Switches, Routers                      | Extreme forwarding capacity, redundancy, low latency. Focus solely on fast packet forwarding. |
| **Wireless Devices** | Wireless Access Points (APs), Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) | SSID management, security (WPA3), roaming, client management.             |
| **Security Devices** | Dedicated Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), VPN gateways, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) | Packet filtering, stateful inspection, deep packet inspection, threat intelligence. |
