2. Create the Right Folder Structure
Each image goes into a separate directory inside EVE’s QEMU structure:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/asav
mkdir -p /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iol-xe
mkdir -p /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iolv2-xe
```

3. Move and Rename the Image
Move your .qcow2 files into the appropriate directory and rename accordingly:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/asav-9.12.qcow2 /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/asav/asav.qcow2
mv ~/Downloads/iol-xe-17.3.1.qcow2 /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iol-xe/virtioa.qcow2
mv ~/Downloads/iolv2-xe-17.3.1.qcow2 /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iolv2-xe/virtioa.qcow2
```

Make sure only one image per folder, and the filenames match EVE’s expectations (asav.qcow2 or virtioa.qcow2).

4. Fix Permissions

```bash
/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions
```

### How to Verify the Images in EVE-NG UI

1. Open the EVE-NG Web UI
2. Go to your lab topology
3. Click Add New Node
4. Select Cisco or use the search bar:
   - Search IOL-XE, IOLV2-XE, or ASAv
5. Drag them into your topology and start your lab!

These will run without CML’s 5-node restriction, giving you greater flexibility for larger simulations and practice labs.

### Bonus: Where to Find refplat.iso
This ISO is bundled with CML releases. Once downloaded, you can mount it and extract:

```bash
hdiutil mount refplat.iso  # On macOS
cp /Volumes/REFPLAT/images/*.qcow2 ~/Downloads/
```

### Summary Table of CML to EVE-NG Integration

| Source File (CML ISO) | Target Folder in EVE-NG | New Filename | Device Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| asav-9.12.qcow2 | /asav/ | asav.qcow2 | Firewall |
| iol-xe-17.3.1.qcow2 | /iol-xe/ | virtioa.qcow2 | Router |
| iolv2-xe-17.3.1.qcow2 | /iolv2-xe/ | virtioa.qcow2 | L2 Switch |
By combining these high-quality .qcow2 images from CML and correctly adapting them into your EVE-NG environment, you unlock a premium-grade lab experience — without licensing or node limits.

How are EVE-NG and PNetLab manage and share labs, both platforms are very similar (PNetLab is essentially a fork of EVE-NG, so there's a lot of shared structure under the hood).

## How EVE-NG and PNetLab Manage and Share Labs

### 1. What are .CFG files in EVE-NG?
These are the saved configurations of individual nodes (routers, switches, etc.) in your lab.

**Details:**

- When you export or save a node's config from EVE-NG, it creates a .CFG file. These are essentially device startup-configs (like show running-config).
- They’re stored in:
  - /opt/unetlab/tmp/0/`<lab-ID>`/`<node-ID>`/configs/
  - or in saved states: /opt/unetlab/labs/`<your-lab-folder>`/`<your-node>`.cfg

**Example:**
If your lab is called ccna-lab.unl, configs may be saved as:
`/opt/unetlab/labs/ccna-lab/node1.cfg`

**Use:**

- When you reboot or reopen the lab, EVE-NG uses the .cfg files to restore node states.
- You can manually edit or replace these configs to preload labs with desired router configs.

### 2. What is a .UNL file?
A .unl file is a lab topology file, written in JSON/XML-like structure but with a .unl extension. 🧠 Think of it as: “Blueprint” of the lab topology — but not the actual configs.

**Contains:**

- Node definitions (device types, image used, console port, etc.)
- Network links (how nodes are connected)
- Position info (where the icons are on the map)
- Node startup configs can be linked, but not stored directly in .unl

**Location:**

`/opt/unetlab/labs/<lab-folder>/<lab-name>.unl`

### 3. How do .UNL files relate to .CFG files?

| .UNL file | .CFG files |
|---|---|
| Describes what the lab is | Contains saved config per node |
| Includes nodes, links, images | Stores each node’s CLI state |
| Can be shared/reused easily | Must be copied to match node IDs |

If you import a .unl file, and don’t have the matching .cfg files, your nodes will start with a default (blank) config unless the .unl also specifies saved states (like snapshots or configs in the same folder).

### 4. Can you use PNetLab .UNL files in EVE-NG?
Yes, with minor tweaks. Both use the same core engine (UNetLab), and .unl file structure is nearly identical.

### Step-by-Step: Importing a PNetLab Lab into EVE-NG

Here's a simple, clean step-by-step guide to import a full PNetLab lab into EVE-NG — including .unl topology and config files — so it works correctly.

#### 1. Get the PNetLab Lab Files
Make sure you have:
- A .unl topology file (e.g. ccna-lab.unl)
- Optional configs/ folder or .cfg files (node configurations)
- A list of required image names
Example PNetLab lab folder:

```text
ccna-lab/
├── ccna-lab.unl
├── configs/          ← optional
│   ├── node1.cfg
│   └── node2.cfg
```

#### 2. Transfer the Lab to EVE-NG

1. Use SCP or WinSCP or CyberDuck(MACOS) to copy the lab folder to your EVE-NG server: /opt/unetlab/labs/
2. Navigate to /opt/unetlab/labs/
3. Drag and drop the ccna-lab/ folder

#### 3. Fix Permissions
Run the EVE-NG permission fixer:

```bash
/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions
```

#### 4. Match Image Names (If Needed)

Open the .unl file:

```bash
nano /opt/unetlab/labs/ccna-lab/ccna-lab.unl
```

Find lines like:

```text
`<type>`iou`</type>`
`<image>`i86bi-linux-l2-adventerprisek9-15.1g.bin`</image>`
```

Make sure the image name matches what you actually have in:
`/opt/unetlab/addons/<type>/`

You can either:

- Rename your image to match the .unl
- OR update the .unl to use your image name

#### 5. Open the Lab in EVE-NG

1. Log in to EVE-NG web UI
2. Navigate to: /Labs/ccna-lab/ccna-lab.unl
3. Open it — you should see the nodes and connections.
4. Start the nodes and check if they load configurations (from .cfg files if available)

### Optional: Verify Node Configs
If the lab included saved configs:
- Right-click a node > Start
- Open the console
- Verify the router/switch has config loaded
- If it boots to blank config, the .cfg files may be missing or mismatched


### Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| Node shows "missing image" | Fix the image name in .unl or rename your image |
| No configs loaded | Make sure .cfg or configs/ folder exists and matches nodes |
| File not showing in GUI | Run fixpermissions and check folder structure |

### Summary

| Task | Command/Action |
|---|---|
| Upload lab | scp or WinSCP to /opt/unetlab/labs/ |
| Fix permissions | /opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions |
| Match image names | Edit .unl or rename image files |
| Open in EVE-NG UI | Browse to the .unl in the Labs menu |
| Confirm saved configs | Ensure .cfg or configs/ matches node names/IDs |

ishare2-cli, is a powerful CLI tool designed specifically for managing EVE-NG image deployments using a shared cloud-based image repo. It's an open-source initiative from the iShare2 community, which maintains a massive repo of prepackaged, ready-to-use EVE-NG images.

### What ishare2-cli Does

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🚀 Pull images easily | Download EVE-NG images (Cisco, Palo, Fortinet, etc.) via a CLI. |
| 📦 Handles import/convert | Automatically places them in /opt/unetlab/addons/, fixes permissions, and converts images. |
| ☁️ Works great on cloud | Ideal for cloud-based EVE-NG setups (e.g., GCP, Azure, Oracle, Hetzner). |
| 📁 Search & list images | Find what’s available, filter by vendor/type, and pull only what you need. |

### Ideal Use Case for You
Since you're building labs using .unl files from PNetLab and want full control on a cloud-hosted EVE-NG server, ishare2-cli helps with:
- Instantly downloading the correct image a .unl topology needs (e.g. vios-adventerprisek9-15.9-3)
- Auto-patching EVE-NG image folders with correct naming
- Speeding up the whole import process (no more hunting for compatible .qcow2 files manually)


### Basic Setup & Usage (Simplified)

1. Install ishare2-cli:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishare2-org/ishare2-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

2. Use it:

Deploying EVE-NG on the cloud unlocks professional-grade labbing anywhere. Combined with tools like iShare2-CLI, you can instantly populate your lab with ready-to-use images — no need to hunt for them manually.
Whether you're migrating from Packet Tracer or scaling up from GNS3, this approach gives you a real-world simulation environment ready for CCNA/CCNP, security, and cloud hybrid labs.


## Why Automate Image Downloads?

- No more wasting hours looking for Cisco, Juniper, Fortinet, or Palo Alto images.
- Easy to integrate with your local or cloud-deployed EVE-NG instance.
- One-click download and install with proper permissions set.
- Saves time when working with prebuilt topologies (like .unl files) from PNETLab or the community.

## Prerequisites
- EVE-NG is already installed (locally via VMware or on a cloud VPS).
- SSH or terminal access to your EVE-NG shell.
- Internet access from within the EVE-NG VM.

✅ Yes, you can absolutely use ishare2-cli on your local EVE-NG VM running in VMware Fusion. In fact, this is a great way to:
- Test the setup and understand how ishare2 works.
- Download and organize images before deploying on a cloud server.
- Avoid wasting cloud resources (and cost) during your learning phase.

## Image Automation for EVE-NG with ishare2-cli
As part of my journey from Packet Tracer to EVE-NG and beyond, I quickly realized that one of the most frustrating bottlenecks was hunting for reliable and compatible device images online. Forums were inconsistent, links expired, and half the time I was unsure if the image would even work.
That all changed when I discovered ishare2-cli — an open-source CLI tool built to integrate with the iShare2 image repo. It acts like a package manager for EVE-NG device images.

### Here's How to Use ishare2-cli on Your Local VMware EVE-NG

**Prerequisites:**
- Your EVE-NG VM is running on VMware Fusion, fully installed and updated.
- You have SSH access or console access into the EVE-NG shell.
- Your EVE-NG VM has internet access (NAT or bridged network works fine).


### Step-by-Step: Installing ishare2-cli Inside Your EVE-NG VM

```bash
# Step 1: SSH into your EVE-NG VM or open terminal in console
ssh root@`<eve-ip-address>`

# Step 2: Download and install ishare2-cli (official repo)
apt update
apt install -y python3-pip git
git clone https://github.com/ishare2-org/ishare2-cli.git
cd ishare2-cli
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Ishare2 [action]
```

📁 This tool will now be ready to download .image files directly into your /opt/unetlab/addons directory.

### Search & Pull Workflow

```bash
# Search for available images (e.g., iosv, iol, asav)
ishare2.py search iosv

# Pull a specific image from the results
ishare2.py pull dynamips | iol | qemu `<ReferenceNumber>`
```

### What Happens During Image Pull?
When you run pull, ishare2-cli does the following:

1. Searches for the requested image by name.
2. Downloads the .image file to the appropriate folder:
   - qemu images → /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/
   - iol images → /opt/unetlab/addons/iol/
   - dynamips → /opt/unetlab/addons/dynamips/
3. The image is not automatically renamed or moved into a subfolder.
4. Manual step: Rename .image to virtioa.qcow2 (or required filename).
5. Create a directory for the image and move it inside:

```bash
mkdir /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iosv-15.6-2T
mv iosv-15.6-2T.image /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iosv-15.6-2T/virtioa.qcow2
```

### Final Step: Fix Permissions

```bash
/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions
```

This ensures the web UI can detect and launch the image.

Pro Tip — Beware of vios_l2-adventerprisek9-M
This image often hangs during boot, responds slowly, and has known limitations with EtherChannel/LACP. If you need a reliable switch lab, consider IOL L2, or newer vIOS-L2 builds instead.
⚠️ Some images like Arista vEOS use the same base image for both router and switch roles. In such cases, the folder name determines how the node appears in EVE-NG. You may need to manually rename the folder to veos or veos-router depending on your use case.
The difference between the vEOS Router and the vEOS Switch in EVE-NG lies in:

| Type | Directory Name | Role in Lab |
|---|---|---|
| Router | /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/veos-router | L3 functionalities |
| Switch | /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/veos | L2 switching |
🔎 Common Causes of IOL L2 Crashes - a known issue with some IOL L2 images, particularly ones like i86bi_Linux-L2-Adventerprisek9-ms.SSA.high_iron_20190423. These are often buggy or unstable in EVE-NG

| Cause | Explanation | Fix/Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| ❌ Corrupt image | Image might be partially broken during transfer or download | Try redownloading from a known stable source |
| ⚠️ Wrong platform/emulation | EVE-NG expects IOL images with specific naming & behavior | Rename correctly and ensure .bin not .qcow2 |
| ⚙️ Missing license (iourc) | IOL requires a valid iourc license file | Make sure /opt/unetlab/addons/iol/bin/iourc is present and valid |
| 🐞 Faulty build | Some images like high_iron are known to crash | Try using a more stable version like i86bi-linux-l2-adventerprisek9-15.1g.bin |
| 🚫 Wrong permissions | EVE can’t access or boot properly | Run unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions after any image work |

⚙️ Why Test Locally?
- You avoid cloud billing while learning.
- You can verify images are working (console boots up, etc).
- Once happy, you can migrate this .qcow2 library to a cloud server later.
🔢 Estimate: Number of Nodes You Can Run
Here’s a quick estimate of the types of images you can run and how many, assuming 12GB RAM assigned to EVE-NG and efficient CPU usage.

| Image Type | RAM per Node | vCPU per Node | Est. Max Nodes | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cisco IOL (Layer 2/3) | 128MB-256MB | ~5-10% | 15-25 nodes | CCNA/CCNP switching/routing |
| Cisco vIOS-L2/L3 | 512MB-768MB | ~10-20% | 6-10 nodes | More realistic IOS XR labs |
| MikroTik CHR | 256MB | Low | 10-15 nodes | Routing/Firewall labs |
| FortiGate (low mem) | ~1024MB+ | Moderate | 4-6 nodes | Security labs |
| Windows 7/10 | 1.5GB-2GB | Moderate/High | 2-3 max | Heavy, only for AD/domain labs |
| Ubuntu CLI only | 512MB | Low | 6-10 nodes | Kali, OpenVPN, Auth, etc. |

No—you shouldn’t need to resort to guestfish or manually mount the QCOW2 to tweak it, as long as you’re using ishare2-cli to pull your images.
ishare2-cli already:
	0.	Downloads the image in a ready-to-use format
	0.	Places it in the correct /opt/unetlab/addons/`<type>`/`<imagename>`/ folder
	0.	Renames it to virtioa.qcow2 (or the appropriate default filename)
	0.	Leaves it fully configured for EVE-NG’s defaults
The only time you’d need to mount and edit with guestfish (or qemu-nbd, etc.) is if you want to:
- Inject custom files (license files, scripts, certificates) into the image before first boot
- Change default credentials or other OS-level settings baked into the image
- Strip out unwanted services to slim it further
But for standard lab use—especially following the EVE-NG “HowTo” docs—you can skip all that. After your ishare2 pull `<image>` and /opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions, just add the node in the GUI and boot it.
If you do need to make small OS-level tweaks (e.g. adding SSH keys, custom banners), I’d recommend:

```bash
# 1. Load the image locally for editing
apt install libguestfs-tools
guestfish --ro -a virtioa.qcow2
```

```text
# 2. At the guestfish prompt:
> run
> mount /dev/sda1 /
> edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config   # or copy-in files
> exit
```
But again—not required for any ishare2-managed image that’s otherwise unmodified.

You can do all of this inside your EVE-NG VM—no need to jump back to your desktop. Here’s how:

1. Install the GuestFS Tools

```bash
# SSH into your EVE-NG VM (or open its console)
ssh root@`<eve-ip>`

# Install the guestfish package (it provides guestfish, virt-cat, etc.)
apt update && apt install -y libguestfs-tools
```

2. Locate Your Image File
By default, an image you pulled with ishare2-cli lives under:
/opt/unetlab/addons/`<type>`/`<image-folder>`/virtioa.qcow2
For example:
/opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iosv-15.6-2T/virtioa.qcow2

3. Mount (Read-Write) with Guestfish
Warning: Always work on a copy of the QCOW2 if you care about the original!

```bash
# Make a copy to play safe
cd /opt/unetlab/addons/qemu/iosv-15.6-2T/
cp virtioa.qcow2 virtioa-edit.qcow2

# Launch guestfish in read-write mode
guestfish --rw -a virtioa-edit.qcow2
```

```text
# At the guestfish> prompt, run:
run                      # discover the partitions
list-filesystems         # see which device has / (e.g. /dev/sda1)
```
	0.	mount /dev/sda1 /        # mount root partition
	0.	Edit or copy files. You can use guestfish’s built-in editor or copy files in/out:

```text
edit /etc/hostname       # built-in editor
copy-in /root/mykey /root/.ssh/authorized_keys  # inject your SSH key
```

	0.	Unmount and quit:

```text
umount /
exit
```

4. Replace the Original (Optional)
Once you’ve validated your changes:

```bash
mv virtioa-edit.qcow2 virtioa.qcow2
/opt/unetlab/wrappers/unl_wrapper -a fixpermissions
```

Then boot the node in EVE-NG; it will use your edited image.

Alternative: QEMU-NBD
If you prefer, you can also use QEMU’s network block device:

```bash
modprobe nbd max_part=8
qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 virtioa.qcow2
mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt
# make edits under /mnt
umount /mnt
qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
```

Both methods achieve the same result—pick whichever you find more comfortable.

```bash
-machine type=pc,accel=kvm \
-cpu host \
-smp cores=2,threads=1,sockets=1 \
-device virtio-scsi-pci,id=scsi0 \
-drive file=disk1.qcow2,if=none,id=hd0,cache=none,format=qcow2 \
-device scsi-hd,drive=hd0 \
-netdev type=tap,id=net0,script=/etc/qemu-ifup \
-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0 \
-nographic \
-serial mon:stdio \
